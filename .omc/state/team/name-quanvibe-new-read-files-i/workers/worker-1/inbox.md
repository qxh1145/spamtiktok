## REQUIRED: Task Lifecycle Commands
You MUST run these commands. Do NOT skip any step.

1. Claim your task:
   omc team api claim-task --input '{"team_name":"name-quanvibe-new-read-files-i","task_id":"1","worker":"worker-1"}' --json
   Save the claim_token from the response.
2. Do the work described below.
3. On completion (use claim_token from step 1):
   omc team api transition-task-status --input '{"team_name":"name-quanvibe-new-read-files-i","task_id":"1","from":"in_progress","to":"completed","claim_token":"<claim_token>"}' --json
4. On failure (use claim_token from step 1):
   omc team api transition-task-status --input '{"team_name":"name-quanvibe-new-read-files-i","task_id":"1","from":"in_progress","to":"failed","claim_token":"<claim_token>"}' --json
5. ACK/progress replies are not a stop signal. Keep executing your assigned or next feasible work until the task is actually complete or failed, then transition and exit.
